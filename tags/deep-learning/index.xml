      <title>How can we design more effective stimulation strategies?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our lack of understanding of multi-electrode interactions
severely limits current stimulation protocols.
For example, current Argus II protocols
simply attempt to minimize electric field interactions
by maximizing phase delays across electrodes using ‘time-multiplexing’.
The assumption is that single-electrode percepts act as
atomic ‘building blocks’ of patterned vision.
However, these building blocks often fail to assemble
into more complex percepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is therefore to develop new stimulation strategies
that minimize perceptual distortions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How can virtual patients improve performance of real sight recovery patients?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Embedding a computational model that can predict the perceptual distortions
encountered by sight restoration (SR) patients in virtual reality (VR)
will enable sighted subjects to act as virtual patients in real-world tasks.
This will allow us to test novel stimulation strategies in high-throughput experiments.
Strategies that result in good VR performance will then be validated in real SR patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, rather than aiming to ‘restore natural vision’,
there is potential merit in borrowing computer vision algorithms
as preprocessing techniques to maximize the usefulness of prosthetic vision.
Edge enhancement and contrast maximization are already routinely used in Argus II.
In the future, more sophisticated techniques such as low-level image enhancements
and visual saliency based transforms could further improve visual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
