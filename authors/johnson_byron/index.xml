      <description>&lt;p&gt;Byron is a PhD student in the Department of Psychological &amp;amp; Brain Sciences. He was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. He moved to New York City to study psychology, where he received a BA in Psychology from St. Johnâ€™s University (2015) and then a MA in Behavioral Neuroscience from Queens College (2017). Byron worked as a Research Operations Manager at a start-up company that develops assistive products for blind and low vision individuals (2017 - 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byron&amp;rsquo;s main research interest is studying how image processing and psychophysics can be used to understand how low vision conditions affect visual tasks. Specifically, how combining computational models with simulated low vision impairment conditions can help inform and enhance individualized vision capabilities. Byron is supervised by Dr. Michael Beyeler in the Bionic Vision Lab and Dr. Miguel Eckstein in the Vision and Image Understanding Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
