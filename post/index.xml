      <title>UCSB Convergence: Reverse engineering the brain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Beyeler and the Bionic Vision Lab are featured heavily in the Spring Edition of UCSB&amp;rsquo;s College of Engineering Convergence Magazine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is research to try to understand the brain—how it works on a mechanistic and algorithmic level—and then there&amp;rsquo;s applying that to an engineered system that can interface with the brain,&amp;rdquo; says Michael Beyeler, an assistant professor in Computer Science and Psychological &amp;amp; Brain Sciences, in providing context for his research, which lies in the emerging interdisciplinary field of neuroengineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Brain-computer interfaces can be used both for treating neurological and mental disorders as well as for understanding brain function,” he says. “Eventually, they should also allow us to restore vision to the blind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>PCMag: Restoring vision with bionic eyes - no longer science fiction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new article appeared in PCMag to celebrate the inauguration of the Bionic Vision Lab at UCSB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionic vision might sound like science fiction, but Dr. Michael Beyeler is working on just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally from Switzerland, Dr. Beyeler is wrapping up his postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington before moving to the University of California Santa Barbara this fall to head up the newly formed Bionic Vision Lab in the Departments of Computer Science and Psychological &amp;amp; Brain Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke with him about this &amp;ldquo;deep fascination with the brain&amp;rdquo; and how he hopes his work will eventually be able to restore vision to the blind. Here are edited and condensed excerpts from our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
